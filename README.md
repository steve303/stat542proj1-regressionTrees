# Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa  

## Objective  
Evaluate and select two machine learning models which can best predict the sales price of a given house from the data set, `Ames_data.csv`. The two models should meet RMSE scores of 0.125 for the first 5 training/test splits and 0.135 for the remaining 5 training/test splits.  Use the R programming language to perform this study.  The two chosen models were:  

1. Decision tree - Gradient boosting model (GBM),  
2. Regression model with ElasticNet penalty.  

See [link](https://steve303.github.io/stat542proj1-regressionTrees/Project1_S21_Report.nb.html) for report.  

## Code File Descriptions  
`PerformanceValidation.Rmd` - contains details of each model and outputs the rmse values documented in report  
`mymain.R` - outputs predictions for the purposes of reporting scores in competition
